# The story of Infinity Hotel

### 1
Frank owns Infinity Hotel, a six floor rest spot and tourist attraction somewhere in Infinite City. This is a hot spot so the rooms are always booked, and Frank
fears he'll start getting complaints if he can't get everyone a room. He sits down in the Infinity Hotel office and thinks, "I need infinite floors so I can have room
for everybody". So he builds up the hotel till it touches the sky and beyond, forever. "Now that my hotel has infinite floors", he says, "I wont get any more
complaints." But he did. The rooms were constantly full and he was getting anxious. He frantically began to build an infinite hall filled with inifinite rooms on
each of the floors. "At last", filled with joy he shouts "now there is room for all of you!" But there wasn't. 

So Frank began to build and he decided he needed more halls to hold more rooms each floor, so it looked like an infinite grid of rooms. Since he had infinite guests
to attend he decided he would just keep building. He built a basement that went down infinite levels, he built floors inside of floors, and rooms inside of rooms and
finally he realized there were no more infinities left. But he was wrong. Frank got complaints from the small people of Infinity City that the counters were too high
and the beds were too big, so Frank got to building. He built infinite rooms that shrunk down infinitely small so that even the tiniest guest could rest, and
infinite rooms that stretched infinitely tall to fit the grandest, at last, all his people could fit. But he was wrong.

Having infinite infities that go ininitely small, large, long, and wide was great, but there was still not enough rooms. He thought long and hard and came to the
conclusion that his guests liked his hotel so much that they would never leave! He decided that every hour he will cycle the guests in every room. But complaints
continued to roll in as the larger guests had issue that the smaller guests were given more time just because their concept of time was a lot slower. So he
decided that he needed a way to have everyone rotate every percieved hour, so now every room would kick out their person after their relative hour, and the
schedules were cut infinitely small.

"What an attraction!" Frank was content, and all of his guests were happy. But Infinity Hotel's name got out and people from other cities began to visit. There
were too many and Frank couldn't do anything about the inflow of people, so he sat back at his desk in Infinity Hotel and thought. "If only I could have a hotel for
each visiting city", was what he thought before jumping from his desk calling the construction company.

"I want a hotel on every block of this street", he said, "and all the other streets too." So Infinity Hotel spread into Infinite Infinity Hotels as each cross street
was infinitely long. It wasn't enough, so he fit an infinite amount more hotels inside of each block. By this time Frank had finally realized that there is no end to
infinity so he dedicated all his time into discovering more infinity. So in an indefinite amount of time he built an infinite amount of cities full of infinite Infinity
Hotels, that spread far and wide accross planet Infinity; he built under ground and in space, on the mountains, and throughout the planet, but it still wasn't
enough. So he inhabited all the planets in his solar system and built an infinite amount more planets to fit inside the solar system, he even made solar systems
around other planets infinitely small. He reached out and built in other solar systems and created an infinite amount of solar systems infinitely small and wide. He
built in every galaxy and created infinitely small and wide galaxies among each other until the entire universe was full of more than infinite Infinity Hotels.

Then he inhabited infinite universes and created infinite universes inside all the other universes so it ranged far and wide, and he felt complete. At this point
hes been crafting for an incredibly long time, and there were no more complaints. He was content. But one day while he was sitting in his office in Infinity Hotel on
planet Infinity, he got a phone call. "Hi, Frank", they said, "I'm from the past. I heard you had a hotel thats a big deal in your present, would you be able to
*come to the past* and build something like that for our times?"

Frank knew what he had to do. From the very instant he finished his work he started going back in time in infinitely small time segments to make sure each instant
had everything. He did this all the way back to the beginning when his hotel had 6 floors. Now *that* time frame had just as the last one with infinite universes
with infinite galaxies with infinite solar systems with infinite planets with infinite cities with infinte streets with infinite hotels with infinite rooms with infinite
floors, all the way back before he even started building. But this was just the past to when he started, so he went back to the beginning of time to the very first
infinitely small instant and made it like the end. Now from the beginning of time there has always existed infinite universes and infinite hotels to hold his guests,
and he believed he was done.

Before rest was an option he got a call. "Hey, uh, Frank, thats cool that you built the past your hotel gig, but since you traveled back in time there are now
infinite time frames", they said, and he knew they were right. So he traveled into every timeline to the very first instant of infinitely small time segment and
built his universes again. So now an infinite amount of time frames had infinite Infinity Hotels, and everyone was content. But they weren't. He got people from
*other dimensions* calling and saying from lower dimensnions, "I've only heard about your hotel gig, I can't quite percieve it but could you make something like
that for us?" And from higher dimensions, "We've been watching you build Infinity Hotel for a while now, but we can only witness and aren't able to exist or enjoy
it the way everyone else does, can you make something like that for us?" So Frank did. And for the second dimension he made a two dimensional infinity hotel
universe that could exist on the second dimension, and on the first dimension he made infinitely small points that existed as hotels for the first dimension, but
now he had the higher dimensions. This was hard for Frank to understand because working on one higher dimension didnt't just mean one extra axis, but an
additional infinite axis on each extra axis. And he built Infinity Hotel on each of the dimensions, escelating it by infinitely long infinities until it was all
finished.

Frank was beginning to get old and struggled to continue building. By the time he was 653 thousand trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion
trillion trillion years old he looked back at his work. In and infinite amount of dimensions from the very beginning of time of every dimension and their infinite
timelines, he had built infinite universes inside of an infinite amount of universes, and each universe had infinite galaxies that existed inside an infinite amount
of galaxies, with infinite solar systems with infinite planets that existed inside and infinte amount more solar systems, with infinte cities that spread far and wide
in space, on land, and under. And in every city was infinte streets with infinite blocks on each street and infinite hotels on each block. And the hotels had infinite
floors above and below ground with infinte halls that that had infinite rooms between each hall, and each floor had infinite floors inside of them. Every room there
existed smaller and smaller rooms to infinitely small sizes and also infinitely large, so that the smallest of people and the grandest of them could all rest
comfortably. And in every timeframe all every person was cycled in their respected frame to an infinitely small segment of time to an infinitly large one. And every
dimension their part.

And Frank was happy, for he felt content with his work. He knew there were infinite more infinites to work with, but he was old and too tired to continue. So Frank
went back to Infinity Hotel on planet Infinity where it all started and sat at his desk in his office. "This is good", he thought, "Now an infinitely small fraction of
my guests are happy". And Frank leaned back and died. He died on every timeframe in every dimension and a funeral was held in memory of him, and in respect, the
funeral was infinitely long.
